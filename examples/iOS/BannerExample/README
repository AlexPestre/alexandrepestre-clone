========== iOS Banner Example ==========

This example does not come bundled with the iOS Google AdMob Ads SDK. You must
add the SDK library and header files into your application.  The SDK files can
be downloaded from http://code.google.com/mobile/ads/download.html.

You must also include you publisher ID from AdMob in the SampleConstants.h file
in order to successfully receive ads.
